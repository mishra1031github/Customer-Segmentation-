# Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
          Perform an exploratory analysis on the dataset.
          Check that the assumptions K-means makes are fulfilled.
          Apply K-means clustering algorithm in order to segment customers.
# Data Set Information
The csv file corresponding used herein was downloaded from Kaggle repository. The dataset contains data about customers from a Mall. The information gather is: Customer ID, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100)

# Analysis
This repository contains two files:
clustering_analysis.ipybn: In this jupyter notebook, exploratory data analysis is performed. Moreover, the algorithm assumptions are checked. K-means is applied to segment customers obtaining a graph and the customer segments. It is also shown how to predict to which segment a new customers belongs to.
customers.csv dataset used to perform the analysis.

The whole analysis was done using JupyterLab and Python, using libraries such as: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
